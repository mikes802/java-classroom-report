# Java Classroom Report
This is the Java project I submitted for my Java Programmer course at Central Michigan University. I did this using Eclipse. It asks for user input for classroom information and ultimately creates a report of classroom numbers, teachers and subjects, and list of students with their ID's and final grades.

I used the following to complete this project:

- An `abstract` class and classes that extend this class (`abstraction` & `inheritance`)
- No-argument `constructors` and constructors that use parameters (`overloading`)
- `Packages` to organize code
- `Getter` and `setter` methods that map to private fields (`encapsulation`)
- `Interface implementation` and overriding to put constraints on information entered
- `Override` the same methods in different classes (`polymorphism`)
- `Do...while loops` so the user can continue creating any number of objects
- `For loops` to iterate through `collections`
- `Javadoc comments` and `block tags` for documentation purposes and readability
