# Java Classroom Report
Java project that asks for user input, ultimately creating a report containing one or more classrooms, the classroom number, teacher and subject, and list of students with their id's and final grades.

I used the following to complete this project:

- an abstract class and classes that extend this class (abstraction & inheritance)
- no argument constructors and constructors that use parameters (overloading)
- packages
- getter and setter methods that map to private fields (encapsulation)
- constraints on information entered using interface implementation and overriding
- different classes override the same methods (polymorphism)
- do...while loops so the user can continue creating any number of objects
- for loops to iterate through collections
- javadoc comments and block tags for documentation purposes and readability
